## Light Nano Node
A Light Nano Node implementation made for Wallets, Exchanges and other services. This Node has been built to be compatible with the official reference implementation of Nano.

## Credits
This project owes its existence to [Mistakia](https://github.com/mistakia/), I have done no research on the core logic and have only have made minor changes to make this compatible with Cesium.
